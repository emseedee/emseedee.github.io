## BMW C650 Consumables, parts and equivalents

For my C650, originally sold for UK market, first registered on 1 March 2013, and described as variant 0133. 
I've concentrated on parts available in the UK; in other markets other alternatives may be available, 
and the BMW part numbers may not be the same.

### Oil filter
According to my research, the OEM part is a Mahle OC306 with a BMW label.
This seems to be used on a wide range of recent BMW bikes, including most of the F-series, 
many of the R-series and even the K-1600. It is listed as being compatible with several BMW part numbers, 
including 11 42 7 673 541 and  11 42 7 719 357

Also listed as equivalents are Hiflofiltro H164 and K&N KN-164

### Oil Drain Plug crush washer
This is a 16mm i/d x 20mm o/d by 2mm thick aluminium washer.
It probably has several BMW part numbers, including 07 11 9 963 252. 
It's listed for C600/650, K1600, HP2, R12GS and several other models.

### Oil intake pipe
This should be fitted at the first service in place of the front oil strainer. If not, it's part number 11 42 8 531 124.

### Air filter
Mahle list their LX3013 as being suitable, and quote the equivalent BMW part number as 13 71 7 724 933.
Hiflofiltro list their HFA7604 as being compatible and say it replaces BMW part 12 72 7 724 933. 
K&N list their BM-6012 as an equivalent (but look out, it's a re-usable one, and isn't cheap).
According to BMW Motorrad Bohling, the OEM part number is 13 71 7 725 170 (and it's eye-wateringly expensive).

### Engine Oil
Approx 3.1 l, including filter change. BMW recommends Castrol, with a grade of SAE 15W-50, 
to specifications API SJ / JATO MA2.

### Variator belt
The BMW part number is 24 82 7 729 767 which costs about &pound;220. The equivalent (with the 
same part number and probably made in the same factory) is made by Mitsuboshi, and is available from Carpimoto in Italy for about &pound;75. 

### Variator rollers
BMW part 24 81 8 536 807, which are 33 grams, and need to be replaced as a set of 8. 
I haven't been able to find an equivalent available in the UK.

### Spark plugs and removal tool
Plug: NGK LMAR8D-J
Removal tool - a long thin-walled 14mm spark plug socket is needed. The Toyota Prius tool apparently works, 
also the BMW Mini one, with a 3 inch long 3/8" extension rod. Lots of options on eBay.

### Ignition coils and removal tool
The coil is BMW part number 12 13 8 569 194 which costs around &pound;102. The equivalent is Intermotor part 1211, 
available from various online motor factors for around &pound;35. The part is also listed for the BMW i3. 
The removal tool is available from BMW, or copies from eBay. I made one using a 3D printer. 
The model is on Thingiverse, item 2247461. I printed it with 3DJake PCTG at 260 degrees with 0.2 mm layers, 80% infill,
 and lying down so that its maximum strength is along the length of the puller. 

### Brake Pads
I use EBC pads as I've found them to be reliable and effective. 
Front pads: EBC SFA142HH
Rear pads: EBC SFA196HH
