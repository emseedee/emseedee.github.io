title: Mike's bikes
---


I've been a motorcyclist for most of my adult life. I bought my first bike, a 98cc Excelsior Consort when I was 16. 
It should have looked a bit like this, although in reality it was rather scruffy. But it was a bike, and it had an engine.

My two most recent bikes have both been BMW C650GT maxi-scooters.

There is some information about parts for the C650 on [this page](C650-parts.html)
