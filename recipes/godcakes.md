A traditional recipe from Coventry, which dates back several centuries.

### Ingredients
#### For the pastry
- 225g self raising flour 
- 85g butter (or baking spread)
- 1 pinch of salt 
- 25g sugar (omit if making a savoury godcake)
- 1 egg, beaten
- about 2 tbsp milk
- caster sugar to decorate

#### For the filling
Christmas mincemeat or other fruit (which may be better precooked) 

### Method
1. Mix the flour, salt and sugar, if used. 
2. Rub in the butter until you have a texture similar to breadcrumbs.
3. Add the egg and enough of the milk to make a soft dough.
4. Wrap the dough in clingfilm and allow it to rest for about 30 minutes in the refrigerator.
5. Roll the dough out to about 5mm thick and trim into 10cm squares.
6. Place a generous teaspoon of filling in the middle of each square, and fold the pastry over to form a triangle.
7. Moisten the edges with water or milk, press them to make a seal and put three small cuts in the top.
8. Brush the top with egg white or milk, and sprinkle with caster sugar.
9. Bake in a hot oven (230°C, or 210°C if using a fan oven) for about 15 minutes until golden.

### Cheat
Alternatively, you could use ready-made puff pastry.
