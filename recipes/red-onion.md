## Red Onion Marmalade

A family favourite that goes well with cheeses and cold meats. Makes about 3 x 400g jars.

### Ingredients
* 4 large red onions (about 1.1 kg) 
* 240 g soft brown sugarÂ  
* 250 ml red wine vinegar 
* 100 ml balsamic vinegar 
* salt and freshly ground black pepper 

### Method
1. Peel the onions and cut into halves, lengthwise, then thinly slice so that you end up with semicircular slices.
2. Put the sliced onions and 2 tbsp of the sugar into a large non reactive pan and cook over a moderate heat for about 25 minutes, or until the onions begin to caramelise.
3. Stir in the vinegars and the rest of the sugar, increase the heat and stir often until most of the liquid has evaporated; this will take around 15 minutes.
4. Season to taste with salt and black pepper and pot into sterilised jars.
