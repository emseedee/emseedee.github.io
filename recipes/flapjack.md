## Oaty Flapjacks

A recipe based on inputs from various sources, including Mary Berry, The Guardian and my wife.

### Ingredients
* 125g butter 
* 90g golden syrup 
* 90g soft light brown sugar 
* 250g oatmeal (a mix of coarse and fine oatmeal)
* demerara sugar to decorate 

### Method
1. Heat oven to 180C (I find fan ovens don't work too well with this recipe). Grease and line a shallow baking tin, about 8 x 12 inches (that's 20 x 30 cm).
2. Add butter, syrup and soft brown sugar to a pan. and stir while warming through until everything is mixed and dissolved.
3. Add in the oats, and mix well.
4. Spoon mixture into baking tin, press down well, and sprinkle with some demerara sugar for a bit of extra crunch.
5. Bake for about 20 minutes if you like a softer flapjack, or 25-30 minutes for a chewy one. Cut into slices while still warm, and remove from the baking tray once cool.
