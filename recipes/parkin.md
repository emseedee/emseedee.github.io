## Mary's Yorkshire sponge parkin

My mum Mary's recipe, dating from way-back-when, and still as good as ever. It freezes well, but it's best to slice it before freezing.

### Ingredients
* 250g self raising flour 
* 150g oatmeal 
* 2 rounded tsp ground ginger 
* 200g sugar 
* 50g butter 
* 250g treacle (see notes) 
* 1 egg, beaten with 280ml milk 
* pinch salt 

### Method
1. Heat oven to 180C / 160C fan. Grease and line a shallow baking tin, about 250mm square by about 30mm deep.
2. Mix oatmeal, flour, ginger and sugar together thoroughly. Warm butter and treacle in a pan, and beat together. Add the dry ingredients and the beaten egg alternately, a little at a time.
3. Pour mixture into tin and bake for about 1.5 hours. When cool, wrap in foil. Best left to mature for 24 hours before eating.

### Notes
In Yorkshire, the stuff that they call "treacle" is known to almost everyone else as golden syrup. It's definitely NOT black treacle!
