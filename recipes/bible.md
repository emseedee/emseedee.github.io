## Bible Cake

Probably best to use the King James version of the Bible for this - results with more modern paraphrases may be not as intended.

### Ingredients
    1. 8 oz Judges 5:25 (last clause) 
    2. 8 oz Jeremiah 6:20 
    3. 1 tbsp 1 Samuel 14:25 
    4. 3 of Jeremiah 17:11 
    5. 8 oz 1 Samuel 30:12 (2nd item) 
    6. 8 oz Nahum 3:12 (chopped) 
    7. 2 oz Numbers 17:8 (blanched and chopped) 
    8. 1 lb 1 Kings 4:22 (1st item) 
    9. Season to taste with 2 Chronicles 9:9 (2nd clause) 
    10. A pinch of Leviticus 2:13 
    11. 1 tsp Amos 4:5 
    12. 3 tbsp of what he drank in Judges 4:19 

### Method
