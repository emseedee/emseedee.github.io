## Website technical information

### Overview
The site is published through github.io, and managed on a Windows 11 PC. Almost all of the content is authored in Markdown, which is converted to HTML using Jekyll. 

Jekyll runs under Linux, so the PC uses Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL) to create a virtual Ubuntu command line environment. 

Jekyll creates an image of the website on the PC; this is copied to the github server using the Github desktop app.
