## Sweet Cucumber Pickle

A nice simple way of using up that summer glut of cucumbers - although it's so good that I often end up buying them so I can make this.

### Ingredients
* 4 large cucumbers 
* 3 medium onions 
* 50g salt 
* For the syrup
  * 570ml white wine vinegar 
  * 450g soft brown sugar 
  * 1/2 tsp ground turmeric 
  * 1/2 tsp ground cloves (optional) 
  * 1 tsp whole mustard seeds 

### Method
1. Wash & slice cucumber and onions very thinly - I find it best to use a mandolin, but watch your fingers!
2. In a large bowl, layer cucumber, onions and salt. Weigh down with a plate and leave for 4 hours.
3. Pour away the liquid, and rinse the slice veg in running water twice. Allow to drain well.
4. Put vinegar, sugar and spices into a large stainless steel pan and stir until sugar is dissolved.
5. Add sliced cucumber and onions to the pan, bring to the boil and simmer for a couple of minutes.
6. Remove the vegetables with a slotted spoon and set aside, then reduce the syrup by boilg for 15-20 minutes
7. Fill warm, sterilised jars with vegetables, without pressing down. Top up jars with syrup, and put lids on jars.

### Credits
I found this recipe on the Cottage Smallholder website, which unfortunately seems to be down at the moment.
