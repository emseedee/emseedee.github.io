title: The bells of Holy Trinity Coventry 
---

This information has been collected from various sites on the internet. I hope you'll find it useful.

The first record of a bell at Holy Trinity was in 1573, when the parish bought a "great bell" from the corporation. 
The bell had originally hung in Whitefriars, where the steeple collapsed in 1572. By 1625 the ring had grown to 5 bells. 

During the early part of the 19th century the tower underwent significant structural work, but by 1831 it became 
necessary to remove 2 of the bells which had cracked, and te remainder were rarely rung. 

The bells were finally removed from Holy Trinity's tower during the renovation that took place inder the 
guidance of George Gilbert Scott in 1856, and installed in a temporary wooden campanile in the churchyard on the 
north side of Priory Row. According to contemporary reports, the wooden structure was not sufficiently 
robust to allow the bells to be rung, and eventually an Ellacombe chiming apparatus was installed that allowed them to be chimed.

In 1966 the tower, which was in a decayed state, was removed to make room for a church centre. The bells were taken to 
Taylor's foundry in Loughborough where they were stored for 10 years before being eventually sold to
Christchuch cathedral in New Zealand for the value of the metal.
