    <h2 id="sweet-cucumber-pickle">Sweet Cucumber Pickle</h2>

<p>A nice simple way of using up that summer glut of cucumbers - although itâ€™s so good that I often end up buying them so I can make this.</p>

<h3 id="ingredients">Ingredients</h3>
<ul>
  <li>4 large cucumbers</li>
  <li>3 medium onions</li>
  <li>50g salt</li>
  <li>For the syrup
    <ul>
      <li>570ml white wine vinegar</li>
      <li>450g soft brown sugar</li>
      <li>1/2 tsp ground turmeric</li>
      <li>1/2 tsp ground cloves (optional)</li>
      <li>1 tsp whole mustard seeds</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<h3 id="method">Method</h3>
<ol>
  <li>Wash &amp; slice cucumber and onions very thinly - I find it best to use a mandolin, but watch your fingers!</li>
  <li>In a large bowl, layer cucumber, onions and salt. Weigh down with a plate and leave for 4 hours.</li>
  <li>Pour away the liquid, and rinse the slice veg in running water twice. Allow to drain well.</li>
  <li>Put vinegar, sugar and spices into a large stainless steel pan and stir until sugar is dissolved.</li>
  <li>Add sliced cucumber and onions to the pan, bring to the boil and simmer for a couple of minutes.</li>
  <li>Remove the vegetables with a slotted spoon and set aside, then reduce the syrup by boiling for 15-20 minutes</li>
  <li>Fill warm, sterilised jars with vegetables, without pressing down. Top up jars with syrup, and put lids on jars.</li>
</ol>
