    <h2 id="oaty-flapjacks">Oaty Flapjacks</h2>

<p>A recipe based on inputs from various sources, including Mary Berry, The Guardian and my wife.</p>

<h3 id="ingredients">Ingredients</h3>
<ul>
  <li>125g butter</li>
  <li>90g golden syrup</li>
  <li>90g soft light brown sugar</li>
  <li>250g oatmeal (a mix of coarse and fine oatmeal)</li>
  <li>demerara sugar to decorate</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="method">Method</h3>
<ol>
  <li>Heat oven to 180C (I find fan ovens don’t work too well with this recipe). Grease and line a shallow baking tin, about 8 x 12 inches (that’s 20 x 30 cm).</li>
  <li>Add butter, syrup and soft brown sugar to a pan. and stir while warming through until everything is mixed and dissolved.</li>
  <li>Add in the oats, and mix well.</li>
  <li>Spoon mixture into baking tin, press down well, and sprinkle with some demerara sugar for a bit of extra crunch.</li>
  <li>Bake for about 20 minutes if you like a softer flapjack, or 25-30 minutes for a chewy one. Cut into slices while still warm, and remove from the baking tray once cool.</li>
</ol>
