<p>Just a normal sourdough recipe based on the “Bake with Jack” website and YouTube channel, links below.</p>

<h3 id="ingredients">Ingredients</h3>
<ul>
  <li>100g sourdough starter</li>
  <li>450g flour</li>
  <li>8g salt</li>
  <li>300ml water at room temperature</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="method">Method</h3>
<ol>
  <li>Mix the starter with some of the water to loosen it, then add the flour, salt and remaining water. Mix with a dough scraper to make a rough dough. Moisten the dough with a spray of water and leave to stand for 30 minutes. </li>
  <li>Tip dough onto a moistened work surface, and using wet hands, fold, stretch and turn dough about a dozen times until well mixed, lump free, and starting to become a little stretchy. Return dough to moistened bowl, spray with a little water, cover with a teatowel and leave to stand for about 2 hours.</li>
  <li>Tip dough onto a moistened work surface, and using wet hands, fold, stretch and turn dough four or five times (or a few more if you’re feeling keen). Return dough to moistened bowl, spray with a little water, cover with a teatowel and leave to stand for about 2 hours.</li>
  <li>Lightly flour the worksurface and the top of the dough, and tip the dough out. Stretch, fold and turn 4 or 5 times, and return the dough to the bowl, covered, for a final hour.</li>
  <li>Turn dough out onto a lightly floured worktop, and stretch, fold and roll into a sausage shape. Place into a floured banneton (seam side up) and put in fridge, uncovered, overnight.</li>
  <li>Put bakestone in oven, then preheat oven to 240C. Place tray of boiling water on oven bottom. Turn dough onto a peel, slash with a grignette, and place in oven. Bake for 15 minutes, then reduce temperature to 190C and bake for a further 20 minutes.</li>
</ol>
