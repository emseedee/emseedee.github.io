<h2 id="archdeacons_court">Archdeacon’s Court</h2>
<p>Originating before 1350, it was originally a chapel in the medieval church and was used a Consistory Court 
where the archdeacon and his staff heard cases of indiscipline against the church’s own legal system. 
The annual Archdeacon’s visitation (when churchwardens are sworn in) also used to take place here. 
The roof dates back from the fifteenth century. Monuments formerly in other parts of the church were re-sited here during the restoration in 1854 - 1856.

<h2 id="glass_fragments">Fragments of Medieval glass</h2>
<p>These are from the “Godiva Window” which was originally on the south side. 
We know from church records that the church windows were rich in medieval glass. 
Sadly the reformers destroyed much of the glass in the sixteenth century. 
These fragments are all that remain and they form a part of one of the Archdeacon’s Court windows.

<h2 id="north_porch">North Porch c.1260</h2>
<p>The oldest part of the building. It was probably constructed in the early thirteenth century to be the 
Prior’s entrance to the Norman church, since the south door of the Priory lay directly opposite. 
The first church built on the Holy Trinity site was the parish church for the lay tenants of the monastic lands, 
which stretched from Radford, Coundon and Keresley to Willenhall, Sowe, Harnall and Hawkesbury. 
This Norman church burned down in 1257 and only the North Porch remained. There is a room above which served as the 
thirteenth century vicarage; records show that the churchwardens leased it to the vicar of Holy Trinity in 1570, 
George Chestton, for 12d per year. Above can be seen the “Priest’s room” which was used as a vicarage in the 16th century 
and is reached by an extremely steep spiral staircase. The north transept consists of a 13th century north wall. 
However, it is mainly 14th century.

<h2 id="peace_chapel">Peace Chapel - formerly St Thomas’ Chapel.</h2>
<p>Founded in 1296 by William de Allesley as an extension to the building; one priest to sing Mass daily at the 
altar dedicated to St Thomas the Martyr (Thomas a Becket).  The stone coffins are Elizabethan and were moved here from the Archdeacon’s Court. 
The glazed openings were a doorway opening into the North Porch. The chapel now contains two Gulf War prayer desks to commemorate 
two young soldiers from Coventry who lost their lives in that war , a stone tablet commemorated to those who lost their lives on 
H. M. S. Coventry in the Falklands War and other memorials.

<h2 id="bishops_chair">The Bishop’s High Chair (1833)</h2>
<p>This was commissioned by the Vicar, Walter Farquhar Hook for his friend, the Bishop of Ross, Moray and Argyle to be “carried” into the church, 
Church of England law precluded Scottish clergy “setting foot” in its churches.

<h2 id="marler_chapel">The Marler Chapel (or Mercers’ Chapel)</h2>
<p>This was founded in 1526-7 and was built by Richard Marler - a rich Coventry Merchant. 
The ceiling which is finely carved (note that Richard Marler’s merchant’s mark is also carved here in the roof) 
at one end only, suggests the stop put to all such embellishments at the Dissolution of the Chantries 
(endowment for priest to celebrate masses for founder’s soul) in about 1550. The chapel was refitted in 1917, 
but suffered some damage during the bomb raids in Holy Week 1941 when a single incendiary bomb broke through the ceiling. 
Burn marks are still visible on the floor. The gold carpet under the altar comes from Westminster Abbey where it formed 
part of the carpet for the coronation of Elizabeth II. Holy Trinity is entitled to this piece because it is a Crown living 
(i.e. the appointment of the vicar is made by the Queen.) The Wooden Reredos in the Marler Chapel is unusual in that everyone is kneeling.
