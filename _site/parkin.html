    <h2 id="marys-yorkshire-sponge-parkin">Mary’s Yorkshire sponge parkin</h2>

<p><img src="assets/images/parkin.jpg" alt="Picture of parkin" /></p>

<p>My mum Mary’s recipe, dating from way-back-when, and still as good as ever. It freezes well, but it’s best to slice it before freezing.</p>

<h3 id="ingredients">Ingredients</h3>
<ul>
  <li>250g self raising flour</li>
  <li>150g oatmeal</li>
  <li>2 rounded tsp ground ginger</li>
  <li>200g sugar</li>
  <li>50g butter</li>
  <li>250g treacle (see notes)</li>
  <li>1 egg, beaten with 280ml milk</li>
  <li>pinch salt</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="method">Method</h3>
<ol>
  <li>Heat oven to 180C / 160C fan. Grease and line a shallow baking tin, about 250mm square by about 30mm deep.</li>
  <li>Mix oatmeal, flour, ginger and sugar together thoroughly. Warn butter and treacle in a pan, and beat together. Add the dry ingredients and the beaten egg alternately, a little at a time.</li>
  <li>Pour mixture into tin and bake for about 1.5 hours. When cool, wrap in foil. Best left to mature for 24 hours before eating.</li>
</ol>

<h3 id="notes">Notes</h3>
<p>In Yorkshire, the stuff that they call “treacle” is known to almost everyone else as golden syrup. It’s definitely NOT black treacle!</p>
